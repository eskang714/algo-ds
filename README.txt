Just an authors note: 
I am a strong believer that programming data structures are fundamentally made of 
abstract ideas we call objects, arrays, and pointers. I believe that fundamentally, 
coding is just having a computer programmed to solve abstract concepts that we must 
break down and create a logical process for it to compute the ideas we have. 
EX1 A data name is an object that points to 'attributes'
    that can either have more objects, arrays, or pointers. 
    Depending on the use case, they can be called:
    Classes/Methods/Functions/Objects...
    .../Arrays(since arrays hold values depending on the use case)/etc...
EX2 Strings and numbers are essentially arrays. 
    Strings are characters in a specific order with a length value. 
    if you are looking for the second character of an array, 
    it will have an index just like an array. 
    If you are looking for the 1 * 10^x value of an array, 
    essentially you are also looking for an index of an array. 
EX3 Pointers, pointers just represent the location of another
    Object. Arrays and hashmaps can have values that point to other 
    Objects. Inputs and outputs of function is like an api. The values 
    are calculated and pointed out or in. 

This is just a collection of algorithms data structures that I have
had time to write down notes and solutions to some problems. 
I hope you find this interesting and entertaining!
